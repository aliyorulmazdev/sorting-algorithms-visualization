# Sorting Algorithms Visualization

This web application visualizes the performance of various sorting algorithms by sorting 100 randomly generated arrays, each containing 100 numbers. The sorting times are measured in milliseconds, and the average times for each sorting algorithm are displayed in a table.

# Getting Startedd

To get started, you can clone this repository and run the following commands:


## Install dependencies
npm install

## Run the app in development mode
npm start


## View App
Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser to view the application. You can also see any lint errors in the console.

## Available Scripts
In this project, you can use the following npm scripts:

npm start: Runs the app in the development mode.
npm test: Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.
npm run build: Builds the app for production.

## How It Works
Click the "Generate Random Arrays" button to initiate the sorting process.
The application will sort 100 arrays using various sorting algorithms and calculate the average sorting time for each algorithm.
The results are displayed in a table, showing the sorting algorithm's name and its average sorting time in milliseconds.

## Supported Sorting Algorithms
The following sorting algorithms are supported in this application:

Bubble Sort
Selection Sort
Quick Sort
Merge Sort
Heap Sort
Counting Sort
Radix Sort
Insertion Sort
Shaker Sort
Shell Sort
Bogo Sort
Lucky Sort
Stooge Sort
Flash Sort
Comb Sort
Gnome Sort
